# Any Effect Dry/Wet (Ableton Effect Rack)
This is an attempt at creating a custom Effect Rack that gives the user a simple Dry/Wet knob for any Effect or Instrument.

This can be useful in many cases. Such as, using my previous Effect Rack [Chain me up](https://github.com/fonkley/chainmeup/), or any other audio effect that doesn't have a global dry/wet knob — for example, "EQ Eight".

## Requirements
- Ableton Live 12.0.0 or above

## How to use
- First, insert the rack into your desired track.
- Then, drag any effect — or multiple effects — into the area on the right of the rack that states ``` Drop Audio Effects Here ```
  - This is the section directly to the right of the "Chain List".
- Finally, dial the "Dry / Wet" macro to your desired dry/wet amount.

If you want, you could also select the (Rand) button to the right of the rack's name for a completely randomised selection.
